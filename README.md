## ‚ú® Features

*   **Two Deployment Methods:**
    *   **Shell Scripts:** Traditional one-click scripts with high automation.
    *   **Docker Deployment (Recommended):** Utilizes Docker and Docker Compose for better environment isolation, consistency, and portability.
*   **Menu-Driven Installation (Shell Method):** The `tcp-wss.sh` script offers a clear menu for selecting services.
*   **Multiple Protocol Support (Deployable via both methods):**
    *   Shadowsocks-rust
    *   V2Ray + WebSocket + TLS (Requires manual Nginx & ACME config for Docker)
    *   Reality (Xray-core)
    *   Hysteria2
    *   V2Ray + WebSocket (No TLS)
*   **Broad OS Compatibility (Shell Method):** Tested on Debian (9+), Ubuntu (16.04+), and CentOS 7+. ARM architecture is supported. (Docker method depends on the host supporting Docker).
*   **Adaptive System Tuning (For Host Machine):** Includes `tcp-window.sh` script to automatically adjust host network parameters (`sysctl.conf`) and resource limits (`limits.conf`) based on detected RAM and CPU cores. **(Requires Reboot)**
*   **Robust Error Handling (Shell Method):** Shell scripts include `set -e` and checks for critical operations.
*   **Shared Code Library (Shell Method):** Uses `common.sh` for reusable functions.
*   **Dedicated Uninstaller (Shell Method):** Provides `uninstall.sh` to remove services installed via shell scripts.
*   **Clear Deployment Options:** README provides detailed guides for both Shell and Docker deployment methods.

## üìú Evolution from Original Version

This script suite has undergone significant improvements compared to its original base (derived from yeahwu/v2ray-wss):

1.  **Created Shared Library (`common.sh`):** Extracted common utility functions to reduce code duplication.
2.  **Refactored Original Scripts:** Utilized the shared library, optimizing structure.
3.  **Added Detailed Comments & Optimized Structure:** Improved code readability.
4.  **Enhanced Error Handling Mechanism:** Introduced `set -e` and error checks for increased reliability.
5.  **Introduced Adaptive System Tuning (`tcp-window.sh`):** Dynamically adjusts host network parameters and limits based on server resources.
6.  **Fixed Script Dependency Issues:** Ensured the main script calls local helper scripts for consistency.
7.  **Added Dedicated Uninstaller (`uninstall.sh`):** Facilitates clean removal of services installed via shell scripts.
8.  **Added Docker Deployment Support:** Provided `docker-compose.yml` and example configurations for containerized deployment.

*(Note: This list highlights major iterative improvements and may not include every minor adjustment.)*

## üöÄ Quick Start: Choose Your Deployment Method

You can choose one of the following methods to deploy the VPN services:

### Method 1: Shell Script One-Click Install (Highly Automated)

1.  **Connect** to your server via SSH.
2.  **(Optional but Highly Recommended)** Run the system tuning script and reboot the host:
    ```bash
    # Download the script (if you haven't already)
    # wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spectramaster/vpn/main/tcp-window.sh
    # chmod +x tcp-window.sh
    sudo bash tcp-window.sh
    sudo reboot
    ```
3.  **Download and run** the main installation script:
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spectramaster/vpn/main/tcp-wss.sh && sudo bash tcp-wss.sh
    ```
    *(Replace `spectramaster/vpn` with the correct repository URL if using a fork).*
4.  **Follow the on-screen menu** to select the desired service. The script will handle most configurations automatically.

**Client Configuration (Shell Method):** After successful installation, the script will display client configuration parameters and import links directly on the screen. Template files are also saved on the server:
*   Shadowsocks-rust: `/etc/shadowsocks/config.json` (Server config) + **Screen Output (Link)**
*   V2Ray+WSS+TLS: `/usr/local/etc/v2ray/client.json` + **Screen Output (Link)**
*   Reality: `/usr/local/etc/xray/reclient.json` + **Screen Output (Link)**
*   Hysteria2: `/etc/hysteria/hyclient.json` + **Screen Output (Link)**
*   V2Ray+WS (No TLS): `/usr/local/etc/v2ray/client.json` + **Screen Output (Link)**

**Uninstallation (Shell Method):**
1.  Navigate to the script directory (e.g., `cd vpn`).
2.  Run `chmod +x uninstall.sh && sudo bash uninstall.sh`.
3.  Follow the menu prompts.

### Method 2: üê≥ Docker Deployment (Recommended, More Flexible & Controlled)

This method uses Docker and Docker Compose, offering better isolation, consistency, and portability.

**Differences from Shell Script Installation:**
*   Services run in containers, not directly modifying the host system (except for network tuning).
*   Configuration files must be **manually prepared** and mounted into containers.
*   UUIDs, passwords, keys, etc., must be **manually generated** and inserted into configuration files.
*   System-level network tuning (`tcp-window.sh`) still needs to be run on the **host machine**.

**Deployment Steps:**

1.  **Prepare Host Machine:**
    *   Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed.
    *   **(Highly Recommended)** Execute the `tcp-window.sh` script from this repository on the **host** for system network optimization, then **reboot the host**:
        ```bash
        # Assuming the script is in the vpn/ directory
        sudo bash tcp-window.sh
        sudo reboot
        ```
2.  **Clone Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/spectramaster/vpn.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd vpn/docker_deployment # Navigate to the Docker config directory
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
    *   Edit the `.env` file to change default ports (if needed to avoid conflicts) and set your ACME email address (if using WSS).
4.  **Prepare Service Configuration Files:**
    *   For **each** service you intend to deploy (V2Ray WSS, Reality, Hysteria2, Shadowsocks-rust), navigate into its respective subdirectory (e.g., `cd v2ray_wss`).
    *   Copy the example configuration file: `cp config.json.example config.json` (filename might vary, e.g., `config.yaml`).
    *   **Edit** the newly copied configuration file (`config.json` or `config.yaml`).
    *   **Important:** Replace all `<PLACEHOLDER>` or `<...>` values with your actual, **manually generated or specified** values. Examples:
        *   `<YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE>`: Replace with your domain name (for Nginx and V2Ray WSS).
        *   `<GENERATE_UUID_HERE>`: Use `uuidgen` command to generate and replace.
        *   `<GENERATE_PASSWORD_HERE>`: Use `openssl rand -base64 32` or similar to generate a strong password and replace.
        *   `<PASTE_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE>`: Run `xray x25519` (requires xray installation) or use a tool to generate a Reality keypair and paste the private key.
        *   `<YOUR_V2RAY_WSPATH>`: Specify a WebSocket path (e.g., `myv2path`) and ensure consistency between V2Ray and Nginx configs.
5.  **Edit `docker-compose.yml`:**
    *   Open the `docker-compose.yml` file.
    *   Locate the service(s) you want to deploy (e.g., `xray_reality:` or `v2ray_wss:`, `nginx_wss:`, `acme_wss:`).
    *   **Uncomment** the definition lines for these services (remove the leading `# `). Ensure related `volumes`, `ports`, `networks`, `environment`, etc., are also uncommented.
6.  **Start Services:**
    *   From within the `docker_deployment` directory, run:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```
    *   The first time you start the ACME service, you might need to manually execute the certificate issuance command, or adjust the `command`/`entrypoint` according to the [acme.sh Docker documentation](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/Run-acme.sh-in-docker) for automation.
7.  **View Logs:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f # View logs for all services
    docker-compose logs -f v2ray_wss # View logs for a specific service (replace v2ray_wss with the service name)
    ```
8.  **Get Client Configuration:** The Docker deployment method **does not** automatically generate client configurations on screen or in files. You need to manually assemble your client settings or import links based on the parameters you **manually configured** (domain, port, UUID, password, path, keys, etc.).

**Uninstallation (Docker Method):**
Uninstalling a Docker deployment is straightforward:
1.  Navigate to the `docker_deployment` directory.
2.  Run `docker-compose down -v` (the `-v` flag removes associated volumes like certificates).
3.  (Optional) Delete the `docker_deployment` directory.

This is **different** from running `uninstall.sh` (which is for services installed via the Shell scripts).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes (General)

1.  **Firewall Rules:** Installation or connection issues are often firewall-related. Ensure your server's firewall (e.g., `ufw`, `firewalld`) or your cloud provider's security group allows incoming traffic on the port(s) used by the installed service.
2.  **System Tuning Requires Reboot:** The `tcp-window.sh` script optimizes host system network parameters. **A server reboot is required** for these changes to take full effect.
3.  **Script Execution:** Always review scripts from the internet before executing them, especially with root privileges. Use these scripts at your own risk.
4.  **AI Assistance:** Parts of these scripts were developed with AI assistance. They have been reviewed, but thorough testing in diverse environments is ongoing.
